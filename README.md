# Data-Exploration-Project
In this Project I Queried Data from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus so we can see more Insights on the Covid-19 Situation.
Things I found interesting: Not all countries share their Data, so this is not a 100% accurate source. We also can see that 2020 was the worst year for everyone, but developed coutries are making their way "back to normal" if we can say it like that. And lastly, Asia, Africa and South America are still being the main focus for the virus, since vaccination is not as fast as other countries and the virus still around with more infections.
